## About This Project

This project is a conversion of a professional PSD template &#x1F9F9; into a fully functional website using only Vanilla CSS and HTML. I deliberately avoided using any CSS frameworks or HTML helpers, relying solely on vanilla code.

It was intended as a design/UI drill of how to manage separate, organized style sheets a concept that became extremely useful when dealing with challenging design elements. This approach aligns well with the "separation of concerns" principle, ensuring that the styling and structure of the code remain clean and maintainable &#10004;.

Key concepts that I honed during this project include:

- **Pixel-Perfect Precision:** Achieving pixel-to-pixel fidelity &#x1F4CF; was essential to meet the designer's expectations and guidelines.

- **Responsiveness:** Ensuring the design looks great across different screen sizes was a priority, as I focused on maximizing responsiveness &#128187;.

This design is based on the contest-winning PSD provided by [Bionocopy](https://gumroad.com/bionocopy), who generously shared it online. The original `.psd` file, as well as a `.png` version, are available in the `src` folder of the project.
